## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User submits registration form
   - Server validates input and checks for existing users
   - Creates new user in PocketBase
   - Automatically logs in the user
   - Redirects to dashboard

2. **Login**:
   - User submits login credentials
   - Server authenticates with PocketBase
   - Creates session and sets cookies
   - Redirects to dashboard or requested page

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Middleware checks for valid session
   - Redirects to login if session is invalid
   - Maintains language preference

## Internationalization

The project uses i18next for translations. Add new languages in `app/i18n/settings.ts`:

```typescript
export const languages = ['en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'ru']
```

Translation files are located in `app/i18n/locales/[language]/`.
